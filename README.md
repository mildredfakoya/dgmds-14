3. Goal of the Project:  Measuring and processing motor skills to detect motor skill developmental delay in children with Autism spectrum Disorder.  

4. Software and Developing tools: Sensor Tile, Unicleo-GUI and Python.  

a. include a GitHub repository : https://github.com/mildredfakoya/dgmds-14  

5. Hardware used: Laptop and sensorTile  
6. Team Meeting Schedule: Individual project â€“ But I intend to spend at least an hour daily.  
7. List of Milestones, week by week:  
Week 1: Setting up the developing environment  
Week 2: Data Collection and Analysis  
Week 3: Wrapping up and Report  

**Children with autism often have problems developing motor skills, such as running, throwing a ball or even learning how to write.**  
This project attempts to collect motion data for signal processing of the following motion:  
i. Hoping on one leg  -- Gross Motor  
ii. hopping on both legs  -- Gross Motor  
iii. Colouring tiny dots   -- Fine Motor  
iv.  picking tiny stones from a garden -- Fine Motor
